<div class="about"> 
  <p>As you can see above, my name is Samo. Although that isn't my birth name, it's what I prefer.</p>
I go to Coastal Carolina University and I major in Anthropology/Geography with a Geography focus. I used to be a DCD major, but I recently switched. Though I am still completely stil unsure of what I want to do.
<p>Some of my interest are music and video games. I enjoy a variety of music even those of different languages! I enjoy plenty games but recently I have been playing a lot of Genshin Impact.</p>
An interesting fact about me is that I have a Pugapoo named Mylo! He just recently turn 1 years old!</div>
